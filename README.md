Splice Junction Classification from Sequences Instructions:
                     You will work on classifying DNA sequences (it is a 3-class classification problem). First, you need to preprocess the data. It contains string values, but you need to convert each sample to numerical values to be able to feed it into ML algorithms. Although normal sequence characters are A T G or C, there are some values as D N S, and R which were described in the dataset source. You need to handle them with care. Finally, you will apply machine learning models to make predictions and compare them with proper metrics.
